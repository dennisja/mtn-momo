## Functionalities

### User provisioning

> This implements api user and key management as explained [here](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/api-documentation/api-description/)

This is needed when developing to get the credentials you will use when getting the access token to access any service. You will need to first obtain a subscription key by subscribing to any of the [mtm momo products](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/products). Once you have subscribed and logged in, you will find the primary key of the product you want to use under your [developer profile](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/developer). Its the primary key. Below are the apis you can use for user provisioning.

- `createAPIUserAndKey` - This returns you all the details you need to provision a user

**Usage**

```js
import { createAPIUserAndKey } from '@dennisja/mtn-momo';

const subscriptionKey =
  'the subscription key of the product as explained above';

const data = await createAPIUserAndKey({
  providerCallbackHost: 'http://localhost',
  subscriptionKey,
});

// data will be in the shape. You can use this to create target api methods as shown below
data = {
  userId: 'the api user id',
  apiKey: 'the api key ',
  targetEnvironment: TargetEnvironment.Sandbox, // should be TargetEnvironment.Production when you go live
  subscriptionKey: 'the primary key of the product',
  providerCallbackHost: 'the url where you want confirmations redirected to',
};
```

> The `createAPIUserAndKey` is all you need to generate user credentials. Its is just a facade around, `createProvisioningClient` that creates a client you will use to make provisioning requests, `createAPIUser` that creates an api user and returns the id of the user, `createAPIKey` that creates an apiKey and returns it and `fetchAPIUser` that returns the `targetEnvironment` and the `providerCallbackHost` as stored by mtn. We recommend that you `createAPIUserAndKey` and only use the other low level functions if you find a use case it doesn't cover

> We don't have versioning exposed because, user provisioning has only one version (v1) unlike other apis that have multiple versions

### Creating tokens

- **Access token**

  This is a token you can use to access other endpoints of the API. You can create an access token for each product by using the `createAccessToken` method. You will barely use this method as creating and regenerating a token when the created one is expired is dealt with by the [API endpoint utilities](#api-endpoints).

```js
import { createAccessToken, TargetEnvironment } from '@dennisja/mtn-momo';

const accessTokenDetails = createAccessToken({
  userId: 'the api user id',
  apiKey: 'the api key ',
  targetEnvironment: TargetEnvironment.Sandbox, // should be TargetEnvironment.Production when you go live
  subscriptionKey: 'the primary key of the product',
  providerCallbackHost: 'the url where you want confirmations redirected to',
}); // returns {accessToken: '',tokenType: 'access_token', expiresIn: 3600 }
```

### API endpoints

- #### Collection API

  - ##### Create collection Api

    Create the methods you will use to access the collection api endpoints. Each end point has a corresponding method to talk to it.

    ```ts
    import {
      createAPIUserAndKey,
      createCollectionAPI,
    } from '@dennisja/mtn-momo';

    const collectionPrimaryKey =
      'The collection api subscription primary key found in your dashboard';

    // You can generate configs to create collectionAPI in development by using the createAPIUserAndKey utility
    // In production you will get the userId, apiKey from your dashboard these are part of the config payload generated by createAPIUserAndKey
    const config = await createAPIUserAndKey({
      providerCallbackHost: 'http://localhost',
      subscriptionKey: collectionPrimaryKey,
    });

    // returns an object containing methods you can use to access the collections api
    const collectionAPI = createCollectionAPI(config);
    ```

  - ##### Request to pay

    This operation is used to request a payment from a consumer (Payer) and is fully documented [here](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/docs/services/collection/operations/RequesttoPay?). Gets back a referenceId you can use to fetch the transaction status.

    ```ts
    import { PartyIDVariant } from '@dennisja/mtn-momo';

    const { referenceId } = await collectionAPI.requestToPay({
      amount: '1000',
      currency: 'EUR',
      externalId: '012345678',
      payer: {
        partyIdType: PartyIDVariant.MSISDN,
        partyId: '256779840633',
      },
      payerMessage: 'message to payer',
      payeeNote: 'note to payee',
    });
    ```

  - ##### Request to pay transaction status

    This operation is used to get the status of a request to pay by using the `referenceId` of the request to pay transaction and is fully documented [here](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/docs/services/collection/operations/RequesttoPayTransactionStatus?)

    ```ts
    // fetch transaction status and details
    const paymentStatusAndDetails =
      await collectionAPI.requestToPayTransactionStatus({
        referenceId,
      });
    ```

  - ##### Get Account balance
    This operation gets the balance of the account and is fully documented [here](https://momodeveloper.mtn.com/docs/services/collection/operations/GetAccountBalance?)

  ```ts
  // fetch user Account balance
  const accountBalance = await collectionAPI.getAccountBalance(); // returns the availableBalance and currency
  ```

- #### **Remittance API**

  - ##### Create remittance API

    Create the methods you will use to access the remittance api endpoints. Each end point has a corresponding method to talk to it.

    import {
      createAPIUserAndKey,
      createRemittanceAPI,
    } from '@dennisja/mtn-momo';

    const remittancePrimaryKey =
      'The remittance api subscription primary key found in your dashboard';

    // You can generate configs to create remittanceAPI in development by using the createAPIUserAndKey utility
    // In production you will get the userId, apiKey from your dashboard these are part of the config payload generated by createAPIUserAndKey
    const config = await createAPIUserAndKey({
      providerCallbackHost: 'http://localhost',
      subscriptionKey: remittancePrimaryKey,
    });

    // returns an object containing methods you can use to access the remittance api
    const remittanceAPI = createRemittanceAPI(config);
    ```
